        <h1> What is a Teacher?</h1>
        <h4>School is not only a place of academic learning, but of social learning as well. A teacher doesn't only
          teach. They also inspire and encourage their students to be their best version of themselves. And this can
          have a tremendous impact on how students interact with others now, and in the future.

          Whether teaching kindergarten, music, physical education or special education, a teacher is someone that
          students look up to, and aspire to be like. Some of our most influential and life-changing role models are
          teachers.

          What does a Teacher do?

          A day in the life of a teacher varies greatly, depending on the subject they teach and the age of their
          students. When teaching kindergarten or elementary students, teachers often cover a broad range of subjects.
          On the other hand, high school teachers will typically specialize in one particular subject, such as math,
          English, music, or science.

          Teachers need to be effective communicators and motivators, as it is irrelevant how much knowledge a teacher
          has if that knowledge cannot be shared and conveyed to the students in an interesting and understandable way.
